Hello! Welcome to the INFORMATICA_4 repository, a personal project focused on the development and publication of academic exercises. This repository serves as a valuable resource for students and educators, focusing on the study and application of programming concepts. My primary focus will be on C++, allowing for a deep exploration of its features and capabilities. Feel free to explore and utilize the exercises for educational purposes!
